Prediction of post-ESD bleeding

## **Abstract**
<i>BACKGROUND</i> </br>
Bleeding is one of the major complications after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in patients with early gastric cancer (EGC); however, there are limited studies on the stratification of the bleeding risk after ESD. </br></br>
<i>AIM</i></br>
To discriminate the risk of bleeding after ESD by using a deep learning model.</br></br>
<i>METHODS</i></br>
Patients with EGC who underwent ESD between January 2010 and June 2020 at the Samsung Medical Center were screened retrospectively. A deep learning model and a clinical model were built based on the development set, and tested in the validation set. The performance of the deep learning and the clinical model were compared using area under the curve (AUC) and net reclassification improvement (NRI). </br></br>
<i>RESULTS</i></br>
A total of 5,629 patients were included, and bleeding after ESD occurred in 325 patients. The AUC of the deep learning model was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.67–0.80), while that of the clinical model was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.63–0.76); the deep learning model showed an improved performance as compared to the clinical model (NRI, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.02–0.27). In patients stratified in the very high-risk group, the bleeding rate was 16.1% according to the deep learning model and 11.6% according to the clinical model. </br></br>
<i>CONCLUSIONS</i></br>
A deep learning model can stratify the bleeding risk after ESD in patients with EGC and its performance was improved compared with that of the clinical model. </br></br>
